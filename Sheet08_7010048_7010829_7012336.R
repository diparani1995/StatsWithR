# a)There is (gender.Rdata) datasets on moodle.
#   Read in the data file (gender.Rdata) 
#   and assign it to a variable called "dat". 
#   See a description of the items in the datasets below.
dat <- read.table("gender.txt",header=TRUE)

# The files contain data from an experiment where people were reading sentences, 
# and pressed the space bar to see the next word. The duration for which a word was 
# viewed before pressing the space bar again is the reading time of the word, and is 
# stored in the file as "WORD_TIME". The experiment had 24 items (given as "ITEM_ID") 
# and 24 subjects (given as "PARTICIPANT"). The order in which the different sentences 
# were presented in the experiment is given in the variable "itemOrder". 


# b) Inspect "dat" and provide 2 plots. 
#    The first plot should provide insights about the relationship between WORD_TIME 
#    and ITEM_TYPE. 
#    For the second plot you should first subset the data using only RELWDINDEX == 0 and
#    then plot the WORD_TIME for the different conditions (ITEM_TYPE).
summary(dat)
head(dat)

ggplot(data=dat,aes(x=ITEM_TYPE,y=WORD_TIME))+
  geom_point() 

subdat <- subset(dat, RELWDINDEX == 0)
ggplot(data=subdat,aes(x=ITEM_TYPE,y=WORD_TIME))+
  geom_point() 

# c) Decide whether you want to exclude any data points (provide not only the code,
#    but also a detailed (!) explanation). 
#    Note that we are evaluating WORD_TIME as our reponse variable. 
#    What time intervals make sense for such an experiment?
# Ans: The two outliers in plot1 (and the three outliers in plot2 RELWDINDEX == 0 analysis) could be excluded.
#      This is because being outliers they could distort the true relationship between the response variable and the features.


# d) Make a scatter plot where for each index word as the sentence progresses (RELWDINDEX),
#    the average reading time is shown for each of the two conditions (ITEM_TYPE).
#    Please use two different colours for the different conditions.

casted <-  cast(dat, RELWDINDEX + ITEM_TYPE ~ .,  mean, value = "WORD_TIME", na.RM = TRUE)
colnames(casted) <- c("RELWDINDEX", "ITEM_TYPE", "AVG_WORD_TIME")
ggplot(data=casted,aes(x=RELWDINDEX,y=AVG_WORD_TIME, color = ITEM_TYPE))+
  geom_point() 


# e) You do not need to use ggplot here, just follow the example below.
#    The code is a plot for the dataset 'sleepstudy' from the package 'lme4'.
#    The figure shows relationships between days without sleeping and reaction 
#    time for each participant (subject) separately.

summary(sleepstudy)
print(xyplot(Reaction ~ Days | Subject, sleepstudy, aspect = "xy",
             layout = c(9,2), type = c("g", "p", "r"),
             index.cond = function(x,y) coef(lm(y ~ x))[1],
             xlab = "Days of sleep deprivation",
             ylab = "Average reaction time (ms)"))

#    Your task is to figure out how to adapt this plot for our data. What do you 
#    conclude regarding the reading sentences experiment 
help("xyplot")
print(xyplot(WORD_TIME ~ RELWDINDEX   | ITEM_TYPE, dat, aspect = "xy",
             layout = c(1,2), type = c("g", "p", "r"),
             index.cond = function(x,y) coef(lm(y ~ x))[1],
             xlab = "RELWDINDEX",
             ylab = "AVG READ TIME"))

# f)  Explain the main need for switching to Linear mixed effect model for the study.
#And, report what could be the fixed and random effect structure.

# g) Experiment with calculating a linear mixed effects model for this study, 
#    and draw the appropriate conclusions 

# h} Describe how would you report and write up the analysis giving a detailed explanation for each model 

# i) Let's get back to the dataset 'sleepstudy'. The following plot shows 
#    subject-specific intercepts and slopes. Adapt this plot for our study 
#    and draw conclusions.

model = lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (Days|Subject), sleepstudy)
